# DDD-meta-analysis
Meta analysis on density-dependent animal dispersal (DDD)

Owner: Nathalie Jreidini (nathalie.jreidini@gmail.com), PhDc, McGill University

This repository was created as part of the Reproducibility and Productivity in Ecology and Evolution class (Fall 2022)

The aim of the project is to compare the effect of density on dispersal (effect sizes as Pearson's r) per taxonomic grouping extracted from literature published over the past 20 years.

This project is being reviewed by Tory Hartley-Cox, September 27th 2022.
